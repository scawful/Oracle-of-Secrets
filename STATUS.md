# Status

Stage: Alpha (per PROJECT.toml)

## What exists today
- Repo contains the Oracle-of-Secrets ASM source tree (see folders like `Core/`, `Dungeons/`, `Items/`).
- `build.bat` exists for Windows builds; manual Asar usage is documented in `Docs/General/AsarUsage.md`.
- `Docs/README.md` exists.

## What does NOT exist
- No LICENSE file at repo root.
- No previous STATUS.md, ROADMAP.md, or REPO_FACTS.json.

## Priorities (next 1-3 weeks)
- Verify the build process (`build.bat` and manual Asar flow).
- Document required inputs and tools (Asar version, ROM input requirements).
- Add distribution policy (patch-only) and keep it current.

## Known issues
- Build process not verified in this status doc.

## Source of truth
- `README.md`
- `Docs/README.md`
