# CLAUDE.md (Compact)

Purpose: concise Claude-specific routing for this folder.

Claude Rules
1. Follow local `AGENTS.md` first when both exist.
2. Keep edits minimal, reversible, and task-scoped.
3. Prefer existing scripts/tools over ad-hoc commands.
4. Validate with focused tests/build checks when possible.
5. Never claim verification that was not actually run.
6. Escalate ambiguity or conflicting requirements quickly.

Response Contract
- What changed
- How it was validated
- Remaining risks or unknowns

Reference Material
- Full legacy guidance: `.context/knowledge/agent-reference.md`.
- Use `README.md` and `docs/` for project behavior details.
