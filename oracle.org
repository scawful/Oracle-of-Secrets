* Technical Debt & Refactoring
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CATEGORY: Infrastructure
  :STRATEGY: Opportunistic
  :END:

This section tracks tasks focused on improving the existing codebase's structure, readability, and maintainability. Per user feedback, these tasks should be tackled opportunistically alongside feature development and bug-fixing to allow for immediate testing and avoid regressions.

** General Infrastructure
*** TODO [#B] Reorganize All Patches into a Central File
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID: infra-patches-all
    :END:
    - *Analysis:* Patches are scattered across multiple files (=time_system.asm=, =all_sprites.asm=, etc.).
    - *Task:* Move all `org` patches that modify vanilla code into =Core/patches.asm=. This file should be organized by bank and functionality for clarity.
    - *Benefit:* Centralizes all direct modifications to the original ROM, making them easier to find, manage, and debug.

*** TODO [#C] Leverage ~struct~ for Complex Data Structures
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID: infra-structs
    :END:
    - *Analysis:* Many systems use parallel arrays or labeled offsets for complex data, which is functional but hard to read.
    - *Task:* Systematically refactor key data structures to use asar's `struct` directive.
    - *Candidates:*
      - [ ] Player Data (Link's state)
      - [ ] Sprite State (Generic sprite properties)
      - [ ] SRAM Layout (Quest flags, item data)

*** TODO [#C] Convert Manual Jump Tables to Use ~table~
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID: infra-tables
    :END:
    - *Analysis:* Jump tables are often created manually with `dw` directives.
    - *Task:* Convert these tables to use asar's `table` directive for simplicity and safety.
    - *Candidates:*
      - [ ] =Items/all_items.asm= (=Link_ConsumeMagicBagItem=)
      - [ ] =Menu/menu.asm= (=Menu_Entry.vectors=)

*** TODO [#C] Document the Dialogue System
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID: infra-dialogue-docs
    :END:
    - *Goal:* Create comprehensive documentation for the game's dialogue and text rendering system.
    - *Blocker For:* [[quest-goron-mines]] (Garo NPC).

** Time System (=Overworld/time_system.asm=)
*** DONE [#B] Refactor Time System [3/3]
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID: refactor-time-system
    :END:
    - *Analysis:* The system is functional but monolithic and uses many magic numbers.
    - *Tasks:*
      - [X] Group all time-related variables (`Hours`, `Minutes`, `TimeSpeed`, color values) into a single `TimeState` struct.
      - [X] Convert all logic blocks (`RunClock`, `DrawClockToHud`, `ColorSubEffect`) into proper `subroutine`s.
      - [X] Break down the large `RunClock` routine into smaller, single-purpose functions (e.g., `TimeSystem_CheckCanRun`, `TimeSystem_IncrementTime`, `TimeSystem_UpdatePalettes`).

** Minecart System (=Sprites/Objects/minecart.asm=)
*** TODO [#B] Refactor Minecart System [0/4]
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID: refactor-minecart
    :END:
    - *Analysis:* An impressive but highly complex system that would benefit greatly from better organization and data-driven design.
    - *Tasks:*
      - [ ] Define a `MinecartTrack` struct and convert the SRAM tracking arrays into a `table` of these structs.
      - [ ] Refactor the four `Minecart_Move...` routines into a single `Minecart_Move` subroutine that uses a lookup table for speed and axis.
      - [ ] Refactor the `Minecart_SetDirection...` routines into a single `Minecart_SetDirection` subroutine that uses lookup tables.
      - [ ] Add high-level block comments to explain the purpose of major routines like `HandleTileDirections` and the track caching system.

** Ice Block System (=Sprites/Objects/ice_block.asm=)
*** TODO [#C] Refactor Ice Block Sprite
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID: refactor-ice-block
    :END:
    - *Analysis:* The logic is straightforward but can be made more compact and readable.
    - *Task:* Refactor the `Sprite_ApplyPush` routine to use a lookup table for setting speed based on direction, instead of a chain of `CMP`/`BEQ` instructions.
    - *Note:* This is a code quality refactor. A separate bug for the collision mechanics is tracked in [[bug-ice-block-collision]].

** Menu System (=Menu/=)
*** DONE [#B] Refactor Menu System [2/2]
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID: refactor-menu
    :END:
    - *Analysis:* The menu system is robust but has some duplicated code and hardcoded values.
    - *Tasks:*
      - [X] Refactor the input handling logic for the Magic Bag, Song Menu, and Ring Box sub-menus into a single, reusable subroutine.
      - [X] Replace all hardcoded menu state values (e.g., `LDA.b #$0C`) with named constants (e.g., `!MENU_STATE_MAGIC_BAG = $0C`).

** Music System (=Music/=)
*** TODO [#C] Improve Music System Workflow [0/3]
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID: improve-music
    :END:
    - *Analysis:* The macro-based system is powerful but could be even more user-friendly for composition.
    - *Tasks:*
      - [ ] Establish a clear naming convention for subroutines (e.g., `.MelodyVerseA`, `.BasslineIntro`) and refactor existing songs to use it.
      - [ ] Create a `Music/common_patterns.asm` library for reusable musical phrases like standard drum beats or arpeggios.
      - [ ] Develop advanced composition macros like `%DefineMeasure(Name, Notes...)` and `%PlayMeasure(Name, Repeats)` to abstract away subroutine creation and calling.

* System Integration & Bugs
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CATEGORY: Integration
  :END:

This section tracks known conflicts between systems and outstanding bugs.

*** ACTIVE [#A] Fix Ice Block Collision and Push Mechanics
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID: bug-ice-block-collision
    :END:
    - *Problem:* Collision logic was too sensitive, touch was unpredictable and the direction could shift while the player is moving.
    - *Solution:* Implemented an intent-based push system requiring Link to be aligned and hold contact for a short duration, with grid snapping for predictable movement.
    - *Status:* Awaiting emulator verification.

*** ACTIVE [#C] Refactor Ice Block Sprite
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID: refactor-ice-block
    :END:
    - *Analysis:* The logic is straightforward but can be made more compact and readable.
    - *Task:* Refactored the `Sprite_ApplyPush` routine to use a lookup table for setting speed based on direction. Converted `IceBlock_CheckForGround` and `Sprite_IceBlock_CheckForSwitch` to subroutines. Replaced magic numbers with constants.
    - *Status:* Awaiting emulator verification.

*** TODO [#A] Resolve ZSOW vs. Lost Woods Conflict
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID: bug-zsow-lostwoods
    :END:
    - *Analysis:* The `lost_woods.asm` puzzle directly conflicts with `ZSCustomOverworld.asm`'s transition handler.
    - *Task:* Refactor `lost_woods.asm` into a proper `JSL`-callable subroutine (`LostWoods_PuzzleHandler`).
    - *Implementation:* Modify the `OverworldHandleTransitions` routine in `ZSCustomOverworld.asm` to check if the current area is the Lost Woods (`#$29`) and call the new handler. The handler should return a status indicating if it has overridden the transition.

*** ACTIVE [#A] ZSOW vs. Day/Night Sprites
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID: bug-zsow-daynight
    :END:
    - *Status:* In progress.
    - *Task:* Triage the crash to identify the root cause and develop a new solution for integrating day/night sprite loading with ZSOW.

*** ACTIVE [#A] ZSOW vs. Song of Storms
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID: bug-zsow-storms
    :END:
    - *Status:* In progress.
    - *Blocker:* This task is blocked by the `ZSOW vs. Day/Night Sprites` regression, as they may be related.

*** ACTIVE [#B] Zora Temple Tasks [0/2] :code:bugfix:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID: bug-zora-temple
    :END:
    - [ ] Zora Follower Sprite Logic: Ensure the Zora Baby follower correctly transitions to a standard sprite and interacts with switches.

** Sprites & Entities
*** TODO [#A] Improve Various Sprites Behavior Quality
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID: quality-sprites
    :END:
    - *Goal:* A general task to review and polish the AI and behavior of various custom sprites.
    - *Note:* This is a high-level task that should be broken down into specific sprite-by-sprite improvements as development continues.

*** TODO [#A] Update Kydrog Boss Fight [1/3] :boss:code:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID: boss-kydrog
    :END:

** Creative Ideas & Brainstorming
*** Sky Area Special Overworld Events
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID: idea-sky-area
    :END:
    - *Goal:* Design puzzles for a cloud-based area accessed with the Song of Soaring.
    - *Ideas:*
      - *Weather Puzzles:* Use the Ocarina to switch between sun and rain. Rain creates new cloud platforms by filling them with water. Sunshine makes electric clouds safe to walk on.
      - *Form-Based Puzzles:* Some clouds are thin and require Minish Form to not fall through. Others have strong winds that blow Minish Link away but not normal Link.
      - *Conduction Puzzles:* Use the Song of Storms to turn a normal cloud into a thundercloud to conduct electricity and power a mechanism.
