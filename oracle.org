* Oracle of Secrets

  ROM Hack for The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past
  Based on the Oracle series and using elements from Minish Cap, Link's Awakening, and other Zelda games.

  - Plot Doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/106e_dnY0EAjm3l416l4NDnpRjlUMFH8EKN_o7eiC77c

* Infrastructure and Organization Improvements
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CATEGORY: Infrastructure
  :END:

This section outlines suggestions for improving the overall structure and maintainability of the "Oracle of Secrets" codebase, primarily by leveraging advanced features of asar.

**Rationale:** As the project grows, a well-organized codebase becomes crucial for efficient development, debugging, and long-term maintenance. These suggestions aim to increase modularity, reduce errors, and improve readability.

*** TODO Reorganize Patches into a Dedicated File
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       infra-patches
    :END:
    - *Current State:* Numerous small `org` patches are located at the end of =Sprites/all_sprites.asm=.
    - *Suggestion:* Create a new top-level file, perhaps =Core/patches.asm=, and move all vanilla code patches there. This file can be organized by bank or functionality.
    - *Benefits:*
      - **Separation of Concerns:** =all_sprites.asm= would only be responsible for including sprite code, not patching the ROM.
      - **Maintainability:** Centralizes all direct modifications to original code, making them easier to find, manage, and debug.

*** TODO Use ~incbin~ for All Binary Data
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       infra-incbin
    :END:
    - *Current State:* GFX data is already well-handled with `incbin`. This is a reminder to continue this practice for all non-code data.
    - *Suggestion:* Ensure all graphics, palettes, level data, etc., are included via `incbin`.
    - *Benefits:*
      - **Cleanliness:** Keeps assembly files focused on logic.
      - **Tooling:** Allows for easier use of external tools to edit binary data.

*** TODO Leverage ~struct~ for Complex Data
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       infra-structs
    :END:
    - *Current State:* RAM addresses are defined with labels (e.g., in =Core/ram.asm=). This is standard, but for complex related data, it can be improved.
    - *Suggestion:* Use asar's `struct` directive for things like sprite state, player data, or complex SRAM layouts.
    - *Benefits:*
      - **Clarity:** Defines data structures in a high-level, readable format.
      - **Maintainability:** Reduces "magic numbers" when accessing data fields. If the structure changes, you only need to update the `struct` definition.

*** TODO Use ~table~ for Jump Tables
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       infra-tables
    :END:
    - *Current State:* Jump tables are created manually with `dw` directives, like in =Items/all_items.asm= for =Link_ConsumeMagicBagItem=.
    - *Suggestion:* Use the `table` directive to create these tables automatically.
    - *Benefits:*
      - **Simplicity:** Less boilerplate code.
      - **Safety:** Can help prevent errors from misaligned table entries.

*** TODO Combine custom room tags into a table system
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       infra-roomtags
    :END:
    - *Current State:* Custom room tags are defined in =Dungeons/crumblefloor_tag.asm= and similar files.
    - *Suggestion:* Create a unified table system for all custom room tags, possibly in a new file like =Dungeons/room_tags.asm=.
    - *Benefits:*
      - **Organization:** Easier to find and manage all custom room tags.
      - **Extensibility:** Simplifies adding new tags in the future.

      - Requires gfx
      - Affects `Dungeons/crumblefloor_tag.asm` cracks, can fall down
    - Lifting `Sprites/Objects/minecart.asm` to another location
      - only works if it is a small corridor so he can't walk back another route
    - a puzzle similar to star puzzle in minish grotto?
      (if you step on the same star twice, you fail the puzzle).
    - walk to the other side of the room without any part of the floor falling down.
      enemies or other things can make it difficult for you.
      If you fail, the door to the next room wont open.
    - only some parts of thefloor are normal and other parts break.
      you put an item in front of you but if it ends up on weak parts of the floor
      it falls down and you have to start over.
      kind of like somaria block try and error on invisible floors
    - when you enter the room there are already cracks on the floor.
      you need an item to fix the floor so that you can walk over it once.
      maybe the song of healing
    - make a crack and fall down in the right place
      so that you end up in the right place on the floor below
