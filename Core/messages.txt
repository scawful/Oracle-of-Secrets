[3]Accept our quest, [L]![K]

# 20
[W:02][S:03]Ah, [L]!
[2]Thank the Goddesses you are

[V]A dark shadow has befallen us.[K]
[V]Kydrog, the Pirate King, has
[V]seized Farore and threatens 
[V]our great island of Kalyxo.[K]
[V][...] [...] [...] 
[V]
[V][K]
[V]Long ago, the island of Kalyxo
[V]was chosen by the Goddess
[V]Farore as her resting place.[K]
[V]The Triforce's essences were
[V]hidden here to protect them
[V]from evil forces.[K]
[V][...] [...] [...]
[V]
[V][K]
[V]Kydrog has learnt of this
[V]ancient legend and now seeks
[V]out the Triforce's power.[K]
[V]He has likely taken Farore
[V]to his pirate ship off the
[V]coast of Kalyxo.[K]
[V][...] [...] [...]
[V]
[V][K]
[V][L], you must gather the
[V]Triforce's essences if you
[V]wish to defeat Kydrog. [K]
[V]The first will be in the 
[V]Mushroom Grotto to the west.
[V]Impa has returned to the Hall[K]
[V]of Secrets, go to her when you
[V]seek guidance in your quest.[K]
[V][...] [...] [...]
[V]
[V][K]
[V]Now, [L], your journey
[V]begins. Good luck, [K]
[V]and have courage, [L].[SFX:2D]

# 21 Kydrog Intro
Well, well, what a surprise!
[2]Look who walked into me trap,
[3]and with Farore, no less.[K]
[V]The lass I've been seekin'.
[V]
[V]I'm Kydrog, the Pirate King,[K]
[V]and I've been waitin' for ye
[V]to show up. Hehehe![K]
[V]Prepare yourself, lad! Ye're
[V]about to be cast away to the
[V]Eon Abyss, just as I was.[K]
[V]A fitting end for a pesky hero,
[V]don't ye think? Hehehe!
[V][...][K]
[V]Oh, and before I forget, let me
[V]leave ye with a joke. Why did
[V]the hero cross the abyss?[K]
[V]To meet his doom [K]
[V]on the other side! Hehehe!

# 22
[W:02][S:03]Ah, [L]!
[2]How fares your journey?
[3]Remember, you must seek out[K]
[V]the Triforce's essences from
[V]across Kalyxo and the Abyss 
[V]to thwart Kydrog's plans.[K]
[V]Impa in the Hall of Secrets
[V]will guide you when in doubt.
[V]I have faith in you, [L][...]

# 23
You've defeated the evil spirit
[2]of the Wolfos! Play the Song of
[3]Healing to free its soul!

# 25
I've been sent by Princess
[2]Zelda to speak with the Oracle
[3]Farore. I was told she would be[K]
[V]waiting for me just west of
[V]the village, near the Great
[V]Maku Tree. [K]
[V]We have to check in regularly
[V]on subjects of our kingdom.
[V][...]   [...]   [...][K]
[V]Do you understand?
[V]    > Yes
[V]       Not at all[CH2I]

# 26
Each time you find a new 
[2]essence, return here and
[3]explore the hall further.[K]
[V]If you don't know what to do
[V]next, you can also visit a
[V]fortune teller.

# 27
[L], you are wonderful!
[2]As I thought, you have the
[3]power of the Hero inside you![K]
[V]Now, you should get the Master
[V]Sword.  I am confident that you
[V]can defeat Kydrog!

# 2B Toadstool Woods Elder Woman Intro
Ah, [L]! I felt your presence.
[2]You’ve escaped the Abyss,
[3]but its shadow lingers...[K]
[V]The winds whisper secrets,
[V]echoes of what’s hidden.
[V]The island remembers, [L].

# 2C Toadstool Woods Elder Woman Main
Long ago, the Zora elders
[2]discovered ancient truths
[3]about the Eon Abyss[...][K]
[V]The Eon Abyss is a realm
[V]where dreams and reality
[V]merge, a place where time[K]
[V]stands still. Deep within
[V]lies a fortress of secrets,
[V]the source of immense power[...][K]
[V]The Triforce, the Pendants,
[V]and the Master Sword are all
[V]linked to this power.[K]
[V]The essences are the key to
[V]locking away this power and
[V]sealing the Abyss.[...][K]
[V]Do you understand the stakes?
[V]    > Yes
[V]       Not at all[CH2I]

# 2D Toadstool Woods Elder Woman End
You must find the Triforce's
[2]essences and stop Kydrog.
[3]The first is in the Mushroom[K]
[V]Grotto, just north of here.
[V]You take care now, [L][...]

# 2F

[V]Hall of Secrets. Farore has
[V]been taken by Kydrog and 
[V]I had to flee. I'm safe now[...]

# 36 Impa Telepathic Abyss 
[W:02][S:03]I sense your despair[...]
[2]Kydrog has cast you into the
[3]Eon Abyss, a place where time[K]
[V]stands still. You must find the 
[V]Moon Pearl. It will protect you
[V]against the dark magic here.[K]
[V]Without it, you will be unable
[V]to defend yourself. Once you
[V]have returned to Kalyxo, seek[K]
[V]out the Maku Tree once again. 
[V]He will know what to do next.
[V]Good luck, [L][...]

[V]If the kingdom of Hyrule
[V]were ever to fall to ruin,
[V]Kalyxo would still stand.[K]
[V]Much like the Sacred Realm,
[V]the gate to the Triforce
[V]rests in this land.

[2]Your newfounded abilities will
[3]allow you to clear the path[K]

[2]This legendary artifact bears
[3]a striking resemblance to the[K]
[V]one you collected back home in
[V]the Kingdom of Hyrule[...][K]
[V][...]surely a coincidence.

# 99 Old Man Mountain
Uhhh[...]  Watch your step.
[2]There are so many monsters.
[3]Could you turn right here?[K]
[V]Young man, are you perhaps 
[V]looking for the pendants
[V]of the Eon Abyss?
[V]Legend has it that collecting
[V]all three marks the hero, and
[V]allows them to wield the[K]
[V]legendary Master Sword.
[V][K]
[V][...]  [...]  [...]
[V]Is it the same one as the
[V]the one in Hyrule? I wonder[...]

# 9A Old Man Mountain
Uhh[...]  Once we go out there, 
[2]you will need to warp us back
[3]to Kalyxo with your mirror.[K]
[V]But the bridge to my cave
[V]is out, so we need to find
[V]the right spot to warp.

# 9B Old Man Mountain
Uhh[...]  Turn right here[...]   [...]
[2]You know, I have a
[3]granddaughter who is your[K]
[V]age[...]  The Pirate King took her
[V]to his ship and she has never
[V]returned.[K]
[V][...]
[V]I'm sure he is trying to
[V]somehow use the power of the[K]
[V]island and its people.
[V][...]

# 9C Old Man Mountain
I don't know who you are, but
[2]I was sent to this wicked place
[3]by the evil witch, Twinrova.[K]
[V]Will you take me back home?  
[V]I lost my lamp[...]

# 9D Old Man Mountain
Uhh[...]  These are dangerous
[2]times[...]  I talked too much.
[3]I used to be a soldier, back[K]
[V]before Hyrule invaded the
[V]island. Those were dark days.
[V]Anyway[...]  Thank you for your[K]
[V]kindness to an old man like me.
[V]Escort me back to my cave and
[V]I will give you a reward.

# 9E Old Man Mountain
All I can do for you now is to
[2]comfort your weariness[...]
[3]Come back here any time.

# 9F Old Man Mountain
The Gold Star will protect you
[2]from dangerous enemies which
[3]lie ahead of you in your quest.[K]
[V]Use it wisely[...]
[V]All I can offer you now is
[V]comfort your weariness[...] [K]
[V]Come back here any time.

# A0 Old Man Mountain
[L], I think the elders
[2]connected the two worlds
[3]deep in the Hall of Secrets.[K]
[V]All I can do for you now is to
[V]comfort your weariness[...]
[V]Come back here any time.

# A1
[...]mumble mumble[...]  My daughter
[2]really liked to play the flute,
[3]but she went missing recently[K]
[V]after the Pirate King arrived
[V]on the island[...] [...] [...]
[V]I wonder where she is and what[K]
[V]she is doing now?[...]
[V][...]  Zzzzzz  Zzzzzz

# A2
[...]mumble mumble[...]  Oh?  This
[2]is my daughter's flute[...]!
[3]Did you meet my daughter?[K]
[V]Where is she?  Is she all right?
[V][...] [...] [...] [...]
[V][K]
[V]Oh, I see[...]  Well, I'm rooting for
[V]you to lift the curse on this 
[V]island and save us all!

# A3
Would you keep the flute?
[2]And will you play its sweet
[3]melody for the dog in the[K]
[V]village square?
[V]I beg of you, please!
[V]My daughter would probably [K]
[V]want it this way[...]
[V][...]But still, I yearn for the day
[V]I can see her once more[...]

# A6
I can't believe you found me!
[2]With your speed, escaping the
[3]pirates must be easy[...][K]
[V]You don't seem like a bad guy,
[V]though[...]
[V]Anyway, because you're so
[V]fast, you should try running
[V]into things[...][K]
[V]For example, the trees at this
[V]ranch have many useful things
[V]hanging in their branches[...]

Thank you, kindly. To tell you

[V]You can see it from the cliffs

[V]Rumor has it that only those
[V]who can soar through the skies
[V]can find their way aboard[...][K]
[V][...]So unless youve got wings
[V]or magic that lets you fly,

[V]Ha ha ha[...]

Hah!  Thank you.  To tell you

OK, if that's what you want,

All right, I'll follow you!

It seems your magic powder

[SPD:00][C:07][S:03][W:02][IMG]Not long ago, the kingdom of

[3]hero to protect the Triforce[...][WT:09]
[V]legends told of an omnipotent
[V]and omniscient Golden Power
[V]that resided in a hidden land.[WT:09][IMG][IMG]
[V]Driven by a need to safeguard
[V]this power, Hylians invaded
[V]Kalyxo, home of Farore.[WT:09]
[V]They claimed it was to protect
[V]the island's magical secrets
[V]from malevolent forces[...][WT:09][IMG][IMG]
[V]But as years passed, the zeal
[V]to protect waned into neglect.
[V]The guardians grew complacent[...]
[V]Dark forces emerged from a
[V]place called the Eon Abyss[...]

I am Zeniea.  I sense something

[V]This must be an omen of the

[V]The prophecy says, "The Hero

[V]If you have the Book Of

[S:02][P:01][W:02][L], because of you, I am
[2]finally freed from Kydrog's 
[3]evil forces. Thank you![K]
[V][...]This island, Kalyxo, was the
[V]hidden sanctuary of the seven
[V]essences of the Triforce.[K]
[V]These mythical artifacts when
[V]brought together can summon
[V]the power of the gods.[K]
[V]Kydrog, the Pirate King, craves
[V]this power and needs Farore
[V]to complete his plan.[K]
[V]He comes from the dreaded Eon
[V]Abyss, a place where time
[V]stands still.[K]
[V]If we are united, we can beat
[V]Kydrog. Our magic can awaken
[V]the true power of the Triforce.[K]
[V]Impa awaits you in the Hall
[V]of Secrets. She will provide
[V]further guidance in this quest.[K]
[V]I can return to my crystal form
[V]and lend you my protection.

[S:02][P:01][W:02][L], because of you, I am

[3]evil forces. Thank you![K]
[V]It's said Tail Palace was once a
[V]place of great rituals, where
[V]echoes of the past still linger.[K]
[V]Kydrog's dark influence has
[V]distorted these echoes, letting
[V]fear and decay take root.[K]
[V]The artifact you seek, the
[V]essence, was a beacon of
[V]hope for our ancestors.[K]
[V]Its energy was said to mirror
[V]the Triforce's power, guiding
[V]those who were lost.[K]
[V]The essence in your hands,
[V]combined with others, might
[V]unravel Kydrog's twisted plans.[K]
[V]Yet, as you tread through
[V]Kalyxo's territories, remember
[V]each temple has secrets.[K]

[V][...]Do you know what happened
[V]to the Kingdom of Kalyxo?
[V]This is the way I heard it[...][K]
[V]When the Kingdom of Hyrule
[V]discovered the Eon Abyss,
[V]they invaded Kalyxo[...][K]
[V][...]seeking to protect the
[V]Triforce from evil, they took
[V]control of the island[K]
[V]Over time, the Kingdom of Hyrule
[V]grew vast, and they paid less
[V]attention to this small island.[K]
[V]Falling into ruin and decay,
[V]Kydrog has seized on this
[V]to seek out the Triforce.[K]
[V]You must restore order to the 
[V]land of Kalyxo, and restore the
[V]honor of the Kingdom of Hyrule[K]
[V]in the eyes of our people.

[V]The Zora, throughout the ages,
[V]have harnessed the mysteries
[V]of time through hidden [K]
[V]technologies. The Ocarina you
[V]wield, and even the Hookshot,
[V]are tools of our invention,[K]
[V]With these tools, we navigated

[V]Hidden within the cascading

[V]Her failed attempts to revive
[V]Ganon lead her to join forces
[V]with Kydrog. Farore was wise[K]
[V]in hiding out here, but the
