[W:02][S:03]Ah, [L]!
[2]Thank the Goddesses you are
[3]alright. I feared the worst.
[V]A dark shadow has befallen us.[K]
[V]Kydrog, the Pirate King, has
[V]seized Farore and threatens 
[V]our great island of Kalyxo.[K]
[V][...] [...] [...] 
[V]
[V][K]
[V]Long ago, the island of Kalyxo
[V]was chosen by the Goddess
[V]Farore as her resting place.[K]
[V]The Triforce's essences were
[V]hidden here to protect them
[V]from evil forces.[K]
[V][...] [...] [...]
[V]
[V][K]
[V]Kydrog has learnt of this
[V]ancient legend and now seeks
[V]out the Triforce's power.[K]
[V]He has likely taken Farore
[V]to his pirate ship off the
[V]coast of Kalyxo.[K]
[V][...] [...] [...]
[V]
[V][K]
[V][L], you must gather the
[V]Triforce's essences if you
[V]wish to defeat Kydrog. [K]
[V]The first will be in the 
[V]Mushroom Grotto to the west.
[V]Impa has returned to the Hall[K]
[V]of Secrets, go to her when you
[V]seek guidance in your quest.[K]
[V][...] [...] [...]
[V]
[V][K]
[V]Now, [L], your journey
[V]begins. Good luck, [K]
[V]and have courage, [L].[SFX:2D]

; 21 Kydrog Intro
Well, well, what a surprise!
[2]Look who walked into me trap,
[3]and with Farore, no less.[K]
[V]The lass I've been seekin'.
[V]
[V]I'm Kydrog, the Pirate King,[K]
[V]and I've been waitin' for ye
[V]to show up. Hehehe![K]
[V]Prepare yourself, lad! Ye're
[V]about to be cast away to the
[V]Eon Abyss, just as I was.[K]
[V]A fitting end for a pesky hero,
[V]don't ye think? Hehehe!
[V][...][K]
[V]Oh, and before I forget, let me
[V]leave ye with a joke. Why did
[V]the hero cross the abyss?[K]
[V]To meet his doom [K]
[V]on the other side! Hehehe!

; 22
[W:02][S:03]Ah, [L]!
[2]How fares your journey?
[3]Remember, you must seek out[K]
[V]the Triforce's essences from
[V]across Kalyxo and the Abyss 
[V]to thwart Kydrog's plans.[K]
[V]Impa in the Hall of Secrets
[V]will guide you when in doubt.
[V]I have faith in you, [L][...]

; 25
I've been sent by Princess
[2]Zelda to speak with the Oracle
[3]Farore. I was told she would be[K]
[V]waiting for me just west of
[V]the village, near the Great
[V]Maku Tree. [K]
[V]We have to check in regularly
[V]on subjects of our kingdom.

[V]Do you understand?
[V]    > Yes
[V]       Not at all[CH2I]

Each time you find a new 
[2]essence, return here and
[3]explore the hall further.[K]
[V]If you don't know what to do
[V]next, you can also visit a
[V]fortune teller.

; 27
[L], you are wonderful!
[2]As I thought, you have the
[3]power of the Hero inside you![K]
[V]Now, you should get the Master
[V]Sword.  I am confident that you
[V]can defeat Kydrog!

; 2B Toadstool Woods Elder Woman Intro
Ah, [L]! I felt your presence.
[2]You’ve escaped the Abyss,
[3]but its shadow lingers...[K]
[V]The winds whisper secrets,
[V]echoes of what’s hidden.
[V]The island remembers, [L].

; 2C Toadstool Woods Elder Woman Main
Long ago, the Zora elders
[2]discovered ancient truths
[3]about the Eon Abyss[…] [K]
[V]The Abyss is a realm
[V]where dreams and reality
[V]merge, a place where
[V]time stands still. Deep within
[V]lies a fortress of secrets,
[V]the source of immense power[…][K]
[V]The Triforce, the Pendants,
[V]and the Master Sword are all
[V]linked to this power.
[V]The essences are the key to
[V]locking away this power and
[V]sealing the Abyss.[…][K]
[V]Kydrog, once a regular man
[V]from the Abyss, tried to harness
[V]this power through crystals
[V]mined by the Goron and used
[V]by the Zora and the magic mirror.
[V]This attempt led to his demise
[V]and transformation into evil.[…][K]
[V]He now seeks the essences to
[V]break the seal and gain control
[V]over the Abyss’s power.
[V]Do you understand the stakes?
[V]    > Yes
[V]       Not at all[CH2I]

; 2D Toadstool Woods Elder Woman End
You must find the Triforce's
[2]essences and stop Kydrog.
[3]The first is in the Mushroom[K]
[V]Grotto, just north of here.
[V]You take care now, [L][...]

; 35 Impa Telepathic Abyss 
[W:02][S:03][L], it's Impa.
[2]I'm speaking to you 
[3]telepathically from the[K]
[V]Hall of Secrets. Farore has
[V]been taken by Kydrog and 
[V]I had to flee. I'm safe now[...][K]

; 36 Impa Telepathic Abyss 
[W:02][S:03]I sense your despair[...]
[2]Kydrog has cast you into the
[3]Eon Abyss, a place where time[K]
[V]stands still. You must find the 
[V]Moon Pearl. It will protect you
[V]against the dark magic here.[K]
[V]Without it, you will be unable
[V]to defend yourself. Once you have 
[V]returned to Kalyxo, seek out the[K]
[V]Maku Tree once again. He will
[V]know what to do next. Good luck,
[V][L][...]

; 6F Master Sword
[W:02][S:03]You've obtained the legendary
[2]Master Sword! With it, you can
[3]vanquish the darkness of the[K]
[V]Eon Abyss and save Farore!

; 70 Meadow Blade Kalyxo Castle Telepathy
[W:02][S:03]As you grasp the hilt,
[2]a familiar essence stirs[...]
[3][...] [...] [...][K]
[V][L], it is I, Farore, bound
[V]within the Meadow Blade[...]
[V]Though captive, my spirit aids[K]
[V]you! Wield this blade to unleash
[V]bursts of light upon foes!
[V]This power flows when you are[K]
[V]in full health. Guard it well
[V]and press onward, [L][...]

; 7E
Surprisingly, the Goddesses
[2]created this world to be a
[3]time capsule of sorts.[K]
[V]If the kingdom of Hyrule
[V]were ever to fall to ruin,
[V]Kalyxo would still stand.[K]
[V]Much like the Sacred Realm,
[V]the gate to the Triforce
[V]rests in this land.

; 80 Deku Butler
Through this way and you will
[2]find the place we once called
[3]home[...][K]
[V]The Tail Palace is infested with 
[V]stalfos pirates and the native
[V]moldorm are most displeased[...]

; 99 Old Man Mountain
Uhhh[...]  Watch your step.
[2]There are so many monsters.
[3]Could you turn right here?[K]
[V]Young man, are you perhaps 
[V]looking for the pendants
[V]of the Eon Abyss?
[V]Legend has it that collecting
[V]all three marks the hero, and
[V]allows them to wield the[K]
[V]legendary Master Sword.
[V][K]
[V][...]  [...]  [...]
[V]Is it the same one as the
[V]the one in Hyrule? I wonder[...]

; 9A Old Man Mountain
Uhh[...]  Once we go out there, 
[2]you will need to warp us back
[3]to Kalyxo with your mirror.[K]
[V]But the bridge to my cave
[V]is out, so we need to find
[V]the right spot to warp.

; 9B Old Man Mountain
Uhh[...]  Turn right here[...]   [...]
[2]You know, I have a
[3]granddaughter who is your[K]
[V]age[...]  The Pirate King took her
[V]to his ship and she has never
[V]returned.[K]
[V][...]
[V]I'm sure he is trying to
[V]somehow use the power of the[K]
[V]island and its people.
[V][...]

; 9C Old Man Mountain
I don't know who you are, but
[2]I was sent to this wicked place
[3]by the evil witch, Twinrova.[K]
[V]Will you take me back home?  
[V]I lost my lamp[...]

; 9D Old Man Mountain
Uhh[...]  These are dangerous
[2]times[...]  I talked too much.
[3]I used to be a soldier, back[K]
[V]before Hyrule invaded the
[V]island. Those were dark days.
[V]Anyway[...]  Thank you for your[K]
[V]kindness to an old man like me.
[V]Escort me back to my cave and
[V]I will give you a reward[K]

; 9E Old Man Mountain
All I can do for you now is to
[2]comfort your weariness[...]
[3]Come back here any time.

; 9F Old Man Mountain
The Gold Star will protect you
[2]from dangerous enemies which
[3]lie ahead of you in your quest.[K]
[V]Use it wisely[...]
[V]All I can offer you now is
[V]comfort your weariness[...] [K]
[V]Come back here any time.

; A0 Old Man Mountain
[L], I think the elders
[2]connected the two worlds
[3]deep in the Hall of Secrets.[K]
[V]All I can do for you now is to
[V]comfort your weariness[...]
[V]Come back here any time.

[...]mumble mumble[...]  My daughter
[2]really liked to play the flute,
[3]but she went missing recently[K]
[V]after the Pirate King arrived

[V]she is doing now?[...]
[V][...]  Zzzzzz  Zzzzzz

[V]Oh, I see[...]  Well, I'm rooting for
[V]you to lift the curse on this 
[V]island and save us all!

; A3
Would you keep the flute?
[2]And will you play its sweet
[3]melody for the dog in the[K]
[V]village square?
[V]I beg of you, please!
[V]My daughter would probably [K]
[V]want it this way[...]
[V][...]But still, I yearn for the day
[V]I can see her once more[...]

The Tail Palace used to be a place
[2]where the Deku and Moldorm

Hello, young hero. I am the
[2]Princess of the Zora. I've been
