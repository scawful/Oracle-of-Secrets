# Gemini Development Guidelines for Oracle of Secrets

This document outlines the established coding conventions, architectural patterns, and best practices observed in the Oracle of Secrets project. Adhering to these guidelines will ensure consistency and maintainability.

## 1. SNES 65816 Processor Basics

### 1.1. Architecture Overview

The 65816 is an 8/16-bit microprocessor used in the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). It operates in two modes: emulation mode (6502-compatible, 8-bit) and native mode (65816, 16-bit). The SNES typically runs in native mode.

### 1.2. Key Registers

- **A (Accumulator):** The primary register for data manipulation. Its size (8-bit or 16-bit) is controlled by the M flag in the Processor Status Register.
- **X, Y (Index Registers):** Used for addressing memory. Their size (8-bit or 16-bit) is controlled by the X flag in the Processor Status Register.
- **S (Stack Pointer):** Points to the current top of the stack.
- **D (Direct Page Register):** Used for direct page addressing, allowing faster access to the first 256 bytes of each bank.
- **DB (Data Bank Register):** Specifies the current 64KB data bank for memory accesses.
- **PB (Program Bank Register):** Specifies the current 64KB program bank for instruction fetches.
- **P (Processor Status Register):** A crucial 8-bit register containing various flags:
    - **N (Negative):** Set if the result of an operation is negative.
    - **V (Overflow):** Set if an arithmetic overflow occurs.
    - **M (Memory/Accumulator Select):** Controls the size of the A register (0=16-bit, 1=8-bit).
    - **X (Index Register Select):** Controls the size of the X and Y registers (0=16-bit, 1=8-bit).
    - **D (Decimal Mode):** Enables BCD arithmetic (rarely used in SNES development).
    - **I (IRQ Disable):** Disables interrupt requests.
    - **Z (Zero):** Set if the result of an operation is zero.
    - **C (Carry):** Used for arithmetic operations and bit shifts.

### 1.3. Processor Status Register (P) Manipulation

- **`SEP #$20` (or `SEP #$30`):** Sets the M flag (and X flag if $30 is used) to 1, switching A (and X/Y) to 8-bit mode.
- **`REP #$20` (or `REP #$30`):** Resets the M flag (and X flag if $30 is used) to 0, switching A (and X/Y) to 16-bit mode.
- **Importance:** Mismatched M/X flags between calling and called routines are a common cause of crashes (BRKs) or unexpected behavior. Always ensure the P register is in the expected state for a given routine, or explicitly set it.

**Practical Example:**
```asm
; INCORRECT: Size mismatch causes corruption
REP #$20        ; A = 16-bit
LDA.w #$1234    ; A = $1234

SEP #$20        ; A = 8-bit now
LDA.w #$1234    ; ERROR: Assembler generates LDA #$34, $12 becomes opcode!

; CORRECT: Match processor state to operation
REP #$20        ; A = 16-bit
LDA.w #$1234    ; A = $1234

SEP #$20        ; A = 8-bit
LDA.b #$12      ; Load only 8-bit value
```

**Best Practice:**
```asm
MyFunction:
    PHP              ; Save caller's processor state
    SEP #$30         ; Set to known 8-bit state
    ; ... your code here ...
    PLP              ; Restore caller's processor state
    RTL
```

See `Docs/General/Troubleshooting.md` Section 3 for comprehensive processor state troubleshooting.

### 1.4. Memory Mapping

- The SNES has a 24-bit address space, allowing access to up to 16MB of ROM/RAM.
- **Banks:** Memory is organized into 256 banks of 64KB each.
- **Direct Page (Bank 00):** The first 256 bytes of bank 00 (`$0000-$00FF`) are special and can be accessed quickly using direct page addressing (when D=0).
- **WRAM (Work RAM):** Located in banks $7E-$7F. This is where most game variables and temporary data are stored.
- **SRAM (Save RAM):** Typically located in banks $70-$7D, used for saving game progress.

## 2. Asar Best Practices

### 2.1. `pushpc`/`pullpc` and `org`

- **Guideline:** While `pushpc`/`pullpc` is good for isolating small, targeted patches, extreme care must be taken. Patches that use `org` to place new code into freespace (e.g., `org $2B8000`) have a dependency on their location within the file. Moving these `org` blocks can break the ROM by changing the memory layout.
- **Rationale:** The order of `incsrc` and `org` directives determines the final ROM layout. Moving a freespace `org` block to a central `patches.asm` file changes this order and will likely cause errors. Simple, single-line patches that modify existing vanilla code can often be moved, but larger blocks of new code should remain in their contextually relevant files.

### 2.2. Scoping and Style

- **Guideline:** The established code style uses labels followed by `{}` brackets to define scope for new blocks of logic. This convention must be followed. The `subroutine`/`endsubroutine` keywords are explicitly *not* to be used in this project.
- **Rationale:** The `subroutine`/`endsubroutine` keywords are not used in this project. Maintaining a consistent style is crucial for readability.

### 2.3. Data Organization

- **Guideline:** For complex, related data (like sprite state or system configurations), use `struct`. For jump tables or data arrays, use `table`.
- **Rationale:** These directives make data structures explicit and readable. They replace confusing pointer arithmetic and manual offset calculations with clear, named accessors, which is less error-prone.

### 2.4. Define Constants for Magic Numbers

- **Guideline:** Avoid hardcoding numerical values. Use `!` or `define()` to create named constants for RAM/SRAM addresses, item IDs, sprite states, tile IDs, etc.
- **Rationale:** This makes the code self-documenting and significantly easier to maintain and debug.

### 2.5. Opcode Size Suffixes (.b, .w, .l)

`asar` can often infer operand sizes, but relying on this can lead to bugs when the processor state (M and X flags) is not what you expect. To write robust, readable, and safe code, you should use explicit size suffixes.

- **`.b` (byte):** Forces an 8-bit operation. Use this when you are certain you are working with a single byte.
    - Example: `LDA.b $7E0010` will correctly load a single byte into the accumulator, regardless of the M flag's state.
- **`.w` (word):** Forces a 16-bit operation. Use this when working with two bytes (a word).
    - Example: `LDA.w $7E0022` will load a 16-bit value. This is essential for correctness if the M flag is 1 (8-bit mode).
- **`.l` (long):** Forces a 24-bit operation, typically for addresses in `JML` or `JSL`.
    - Example: `JSL.l SomeRoutineInAnotherBank`

**Golden Rule:** A mismatch between the M/X flags and the intended operation size is a primary cause of crashes. When in doubt, wrap your code in `REP`/`SEP` to explicitly set the processor state, and use size suffixes to make your intent clear to both the assembler and future developers.

## 3. Project-Specific Conventions

### 3.1. File & Directory Structure

- The project is well-organized by functionality (`Core`, `Items`, `Sprites`, `Overworld`, etc.). New code should be placed in the appropriate directory.
- Central include files (e.g., `all_items.asm`, `all_sprites.asm`) are used to aggregate modules. This is a good pattern to continue.

### 3.2. Patch Management

- **Guideline:** Hooks and patches should be placed logically near the code they relate to, not centralized in `Core/patches.asm`. This improves code organization, maintainability, and context preservation.
- **Rationale:** When a hook modifies vanilla behavior to add custom functionality, placing the hook in the same file as the custom implementation keeps related code together. This makes it easier to understand the complete feature, debug issues, and maintain the codebase.
- **Exception:** Only truly generic, cross-cutting patches that don't belong to any specific feature should be considered for `Core/patches.asm`.

### 3.3. Debugging

- The `!DEBUG` flag and `%print_debug()` macro in `Util/macros.asm` should be used for all build-time logging. This allows for easy enabling/disabling of diagnostic messages.

### 3.4. Referencing Vanilla Code (`usdasm`)

- When hooking or modifying vanilla code, it is essential to understand the original context. The `usdasm` disassembly is the primary reference for this.
- To find the original code for a patch at a given address (e.g., `$07A3DB`), you can search for the SNES address in the `usdasm` files (e.g., `#_07A3DB:`).
- **Vanilla labels are not included by default.** The `usdasm` project is a reference, not part of the build. If you need to call a vanilla routine, you must find its implementation in the disassembly and explicitly copy or recreate it within the `Oracle of Secrets` source, giving it a new label (e.g., inside the `Oracle` namespace).
- **Disassembly files are for reference only.** Never modify any files within the `usdasm` directory. All changes must be made within the `Oracle of Secrets` project files.

### 3.5. Namespacing

- **Guideline:** The majority of the *Oracle of Secrets* codebase is organized within an `Oracle` namespace, as defined in `Oracle_main.asm`. However, some modules, notably `ZSCustomOverworld.asm`, are included *outside* of this namespace.
- **Interaction:** To call a function that is inside the `Oracle` namespace from a file that is outside of it (like `ZSCustomOverworld.asm`), you must prefix the function's label with `Oracle_`. For example, to call the `CheckIfNight16Bit` function (defined inside the namespace), you must use `JSL Oracle_CheckIfNight16Bit`.
- **Rationale:** The build process correctly resolves these `Oracle_` prefixed labels to their namespaced counterparts (e.g., `Oracle.CheckIfNight16Bit`). Do not add the `Oracle_` prefix to the original function definition; it is only used by the calling code outside the namespace.

**Practical Example - Oracle to ZScream:**
```asm
// In ZScream file (no namespace):
LoadOverworldSprites_Interupt:
{
    ; ZScream code here
    RTL
}

// Export to Oracle namespace:
namespace Oracle
{
    Oracle_LoadOverworldSprites_Interupt = LoadOverworldSprites_Interupt
}

// Now Oracle code can call it:
namespace Oracle
{
    MyFunction:
        JSL Oracle_LoadOverworldSprites_Interupt  ; Use prefix!
        RTL
}
```

**Practical Example - ZScream to Oracle (Bridge Pattern):**
```asm
// Oracle implementation:
namespace Oracle
{
    CheckIfNight:
        LDA.l $7EE000  ; Check time system
        ; ... logic ...
        RTL
}

// Bridge function (no namespace):
ZSO_CheckIfNight:
{
    JSL Oracle_CheckIfNight  ; Can call INTO Oracle
    RTL
}

// Export bridge:
namespace Oracle
{
    Oracle_ZSO_CheckIfNight = ZSO_CheckIfNight
}

// ZScream hook can use it:
org $09C4C7
LoadOverworldSprites_Hook:
    JSL Oracle_ZSO_CheckIfNight  ; Bridge function
```

- `Docs/World/Overworld/ZSCustomOverworldAdvanced.md` Section 5 (Cross-Namespace Integration)
- `Docs/General/Troubleshooting.md` Section 5 (Cross-Namespace Calling)
- `Docs/General/DevelopmentGuidelines.md` Section 2.4 (Namespace Architecture)

### 3.6. Safe Hooking and Code Injection

When modifying vanilla game logic, it is critical to never edit the disassembly files in `ALTTP/` or `usdasm/` directly. Instead, use the following safe hooking method to inject custom code.

- **1. Identify a Target and Free Space:**
  - Locate the exact address in the vanilla code you want to modify (the "hook point").
  - Identify a free bank or region in the ROM to place your new, expanded code.

- **2. Choose the Appropriate File for Your Hook:**
  - **Feature-Specific Hooks:** Place hooks in the same file as the custom implementation they enable. For example, if you're adding a new item feature in `Items/magic_ring.asm`, place the vanilla hook in that same file.
  - **Module-Specific Hooks:** For hooks that modify core game systems (sprite engine, player engine, etc.), place them in the relevant module file within the `Core/` directory.
  - **Generic Patches:** Only place truly generic, cross-cutting modifications in `Core/patches.asm` (e.g., fixes to vanilla bugs, performance optimizations).
  - **Rationale:** Co-locating hooks with their implementations improves code organization, makes features self-contained, and provides better context for future maintenance.

- **3. Write the Hook:**
  - Use `pushpc` and `pullpc` to isolate your patch.
  - Use `org` to navigate to the target address in the vanilla code.
  - At the target address, overwrite the original instruction(s) with a `JSL` (or `JMP`) to your new custom routine in free space.
  - **Crucially, ensure your `JSL`/`JMP` instruction and any necessary `NOP`s perfectly replace the original instruction(s) byte-for-byte.** A `JSL` is 4 bytes. If you overwrite an instruction that is only 2 bytes, you must add `NOP` instructions to fill the remaining 2 bytes to avoid corrupting the subsequent instruction.

- **4. Implement the Custom Routine:**
  - In a `freedata` block (or using `org` with a free space address), write your new routine in the same file as the hook.
  - **Preserve Overwritten Code:** The first thing your new routine must do is execute the exact vanilla instruction(s) that you overwrote with your `JSL`. This is essential to maintain the original game's behavior.
  - After preserving the original logic, add your new custom code.
  - End your routine with an `RTL` (to return from a `JSL`) or `RTS` (to return from a `JSR`).

- **Example (Feature-Specific Hook):**
  ```asm
  ; In Items/magic_ring.asm

  ; 1. Place the new, expanded logic in a free bank.
  org $348000
  MagicRing_CustomEffect:
  {
    ; 2. First, execute the original instruction(s) that were overwritten.
    LDA.b #$01         ; Example: Original instruction was LDA #$01 (2 bytes)
    STA.w $0DD0,X      ; Example: Original instruction was STA $0DD0,X (3 bytes)

    ; 3. Now, add your new custom logic for the magic ring.
    LDA.l MagicRing    ; Check if player has magic ring
    BEQ .no_ring
      LDA.b #$FF       ; Apply ring's special effect
      STA.w $1234,X
    .no_ring

    ; 4. Return to the vanilla code.
    RTL
  }

  ; 5. Hook placement: In the same file, near the feature implementation
  pushpc
  org $05C227 ; Target address in vanilla sprite damage routine
  JSL MagicRing_CustomEffect ; JSL is 4 bytes.
  NOP ; Fill the 5th byte since we overwrote two instructions (2+3=5 bytes)
  pullpc
  ```

- **Example (Core System Hook):**
  ```asm
  ; In Core/sprite_engine_hooks.asm (or similar)

  org $348100
  CustomSprite_DeathHandler:
  {
    ; Preserve original death logic
    LDA.w SprHealth, X
    BNE .not_dead
      ; Original vanilla death code here
      JSL Sprite_SpawnDeathAnimation
    .not_dead
    
    ; Add custom death effects for Oracle sprites
    LDA.w SprType, X
    CMP.b #CustomSpriteID : BNE .skip_custom
      JSR CustomSprite_SpecialDeath
    .skip_custom
    
    RTL
  }

  ; Hook in same file
  pushpc
  org $068450
  JSL CustomSprite_DeathHandler
  pullpc
  ```

## 4. Build Process and ROM Management

- **Clean ROM**: The clean, unmodified "The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past" ROM should be placed at `Roms/oos169.sfc`. This path is included in `.gitignore`, so the ROM file will not be committed to the repository.
- **Build Script**: A `build.sh` script is provided to automate the build process. For detailed usage, see `Docs/General/AsarUsage.md`.
- **Workflow**: The build script creates a fresh copy of the clean ROM and applies the `Oracle_main.asm` patch to it using `asar`.
- **Important**: Never apply patches directly to `Roms/oos169.sfc`. Always use the build script to create a new, patched ROM. This ensures the clean ROM remains untouched for future builds.

## 5. Debugging Tips for BRKs and Crashes

When encountering unexpected crashes (often indicated by a `BRK` instruction in emulators), especially after modifying code, consider the following:

**For comprehensive debugging guidance with step-by-step procedures, see `Docs/General/Troubleshooting.md`.**

### 5.1. Most Common Causes

- **Processor Status Register (P) Mismatch:** This is a very common cause. If a routine expects 8-bit accumulator/index registers (M=1, X=1) but is called when they are 16-bit (M=0, X=0), or vice-versa, memory accesses and arithmetic operations will be incorrect, leading to crashes.

**Example:**
```asm
; BAD: Size mismatch
REP #$20        ; A = 16-bit
JSL Function    ; Function expects 8-bit!

; Inside Function:
SEP #$20        ; Sets 8-bit mode
LDA.b #$FF
STA.w $1234     ; Only stores $FF, not $00FF!
RTL             ; ← Doesn't restore caller's 16-bit mode

; GOOD: Preserve state
Function:
    PHP         ; Save caller's state
    SEP #$20    ; Set to 8-bit
    LDA.b #$FF
    STA.w $1234
    PLP         ; Restore caller's state
    RTL
```

- **Stack Corruption:** JSL/JSR push the return address onto the stack. If a called routine pushes too much data onto the stack without popping it, or if the stack pointer (`S`) is corrupted, the return address can be overwritten, leading to a crash when `RTL`/`RTS` is executed.
    - **`JSR`/`RTS` vs `JSL`/`RTL` Mismatch:** This is a critical and common error.
        - `JSR` (Jump to Subroutine) pushes a 2-byte return address. It **must** be paired with `RTS` (Return from Subroutine), which pulls 2 bytes.
        - `JSL` (Jump to Subroutine Long) pushes a 3-byte return address (including the bank). It **must** be paired with `RTL` (Return from Subroutine Long), which pulls 3 bytes.

**Example:**
```asm
; BAD: Mismatched call/return
MainFunction:
    JSL SubFunction  ; Pushes 3 bytes ($02 $C4 $09)
    
SubFunction:
    ; ... code ...
    RTS  ; ← ERROR: Only pops 2 bytes! Stack corrupted!

; GOOD: Matched call/return
MainFunction:
    JSL SubFunction  ; Pushes 3 bytes
    
SubFunction:
    ; ... code ...
    RTL  ; ← Correct: Pops 3 bytes
```

### 5.2. Debugging Tools

- **Mesen-S (Recommended):** The most powerful SNES debugger:
    - Set breakpoints with conditions: `A == #$42`
    - Memory watchpoints: `[W]$7E0730` (break on write)
    - Stack viewer to trace call history
    - Event viewer for NMI/IRQ timing
    - Break on BRK automatically

**Quick Mesen-S Workflow:**
1. Enable "Break on BRK" in Debugger settings
2. When crash occurs, check Stack viewer
3. Read return addresses to trace call history
4. Set breakpoint before suspected crash location
5. Step through code examining registers

- **Breadcrumb Tracking:**
```asm
; Add markers to narrow down crash location
LDA.b #$01 : STA.l $7F5000  ; Breadcrumb 1
JSL SuspiciousFunction
LDA.b #$02 : STA.l $7F5000  ; Breadcrumb 2
JSL AnotherFunction
LDA.b #$03 : STA.l $7F5000  ; Breadcrumb 3

; After crash, check $7F5000 in memory viewer
; If value is $02, crash occurred in AnotherFunction
```

### 5.3. Common Error Patterns

**Pattern 1: Jumping to $000000 (BRK)**
- Cause: Corrupted jump address or return address
- Debug: Check stack contents, verify JSL/JSR is called before RTL/RTS

**Pattern 2: Infinite Loop / Freeze**
- Cause: Forgot to increment module/submodule, infinite recursion
- Debug: Check that `$10` (module) or `$11` (submodule) is incremented

**Pattern 3: Wrong Graphics / Corrupted Screen**
- Cause: DMA during active display, wrong VRAM address
- Debug: Ensure graphics updates only during NMI or Force Blank

- **ZScream-Specific:** `Docs/General/Troubleshooting.md` Section 8



## 6. Verification Policy

- **Bugs and Features:** Never mark a bug fix or feature implementation as `DONE` until it has been thoroughly tested and verified in an emulator. This ensures stability and prevents regressions.


## 7. Memory and Symbol Analysis

This section details the layout and purpose of critical memory regions (WRAM and SRAM) and the symbol definition files that give them context.

**For comprehensive memory documentation, see:**
- `Docs/Core/MemoryMap.md` - Complete WRAM/SRAM map with verified custom variables
- `Docs/Core/Ram.md` - High-level overview of memory usage
- `Docs/General/Troubleshooting.md` Section 6 - Memory conflict resolution

### 7.1. WRAM (Work RAM) Analysis

Work RAM (WRAM) holds the active, volatile state of the entire game. The following are some of the most critical variables for understanding real-time game logic.

*   **Direct Page & Scrap (`$7E0000` - `$7E000F`):** A highly volatile scratchpad for temporary, single-frame calculations.
*   **Main Game State (`$7E0010` - `$7E001F`):**
    *   `MODE` (`$7E0010`): The primary game state variable (Overworld, Underworld, Menu, etc.). This dictates which main module is executed each frame.
    *   `INDOORS` (`$7E001B`): A flag (`0x01` for indoors, `0x00` for outdoors) controlling environmental factors.
*   **Link's State (`$7E0020`+):** A large block containing the player's immediate state.
    *   `POSX`/`POSY`/`POSZ`: Link's 16-bit absolute coordinates.
    *   `LINKDO` (`$7E005D`): Link's personal state machine variable (walking, swimming, lifting, etc.), used by the player engine in Bank $07.
    *   `IFRAMES` (`$7E031F`): Invincibility frame timer after taking damage.
*   **Area & Room State (`$7E008A` - `$7E00AF`):**
    *   `OWSCR` (`$7E008A`): The current Overworld screen ID.
    *   `ROOM` (`$7E00A0`): The current Underworld room ID.
*   **Sprite and Ancilla Data (`$7E0D00+`):** `Core/symbols.asm` maps the data structures for all sprites and ancillae (projectiles, effects). Key variables include `SprState` (state machine), `SprType` (ID), `SprHealth`, and coordinates. This is fundamental to all NPC and enemy logic.
*   **Oracle of Secrets Custom WRAM (`$7E0730+`):** A custom region for new features. Notable variables include `GoldstarOrHookshot` and `FishingOrPortalRod`, used to manage the state of new custom items.

### 7.2. SRAM (Save RAM) Analysis

SRAM stores the player's save file, including long-term progression and inventory. `Core/sram.asm` reveals significant customization for Oracle of Secrets.

#### Vanilla ALTTP Save Data:
*   **Inventory:** `Bow` (`$7EF340`), `Bombs` (`$7EF343`), `Sword` (`$7EF359`), `Shield` (`$7EF35A`).
*   **Player Status:** `Rupees` (`$7EF360`), `MAXHP` (`$7EF36C`), `CURHP` (`$7EF36D`).
*   **Progression:** `Pendants` (`$7EF374`), `Crystals` (`$7EF37A`), `GAMESTATE` (`$7EF3C5`).

#### Oracle of Secrets (OOS) Custom SRAM Data:
This highlights the major new features of the hack.
*   **New Items & Masks:** `ZoraMask` (`$7EF347`), `BunnyHood` (`$7EF348`), `DekuMask` (`$7EF349`), `RocsFeather` (`$7EF34D`), etc. These introduce major new player abilities.
*   **New Progression System:**
    *   `OOSPROG` (`$7EF3D6`): A primary bitfield for major quest milestones unique to OOS.
    *   `Dreams` (`$7EF410`): A new collectible concept.
*   **New Collectibles & Side-Quests:** A block from `$7EF38B` holds new items like `Bananas`, `Seashells`, and `Honeycomb`. `MagicBeanProg` (`$7EF39B`) tracks a new multi-day side-quest.

### 7.3. Symbols and Functions (`Core/symbols.asm`)

This file acts as a central header, defining constants and labels for memory addresses and functions to make the assembly code readable and maintainable.

*   **Function Pointers:** It provides labels for critical functions across different ROM banks (e.g., `Sprite_CheckDamageToPlayer`, `EnableForceBlank`), allowing for modular code.
*   **Memory Maps:** It contains the definitive memory maps for WRAM structures, most notably for sprites and ancillae.
*   **Readability:** Its primary purpose is to replace "magic numbers" (raw addresses) with human-readable labels, which is essential for a project of this scale.

## 8. Disassembly Analysis and Search Guide

This section provides a high-level analysis of key banks in the Link to the Past disassembly. Use this guide to quickly locate relevant code and understand the overall structure of the game.

### 8.1. Bank $00: Game Core & Main Loop

**File:** `ALTTP/bank_00.asm`
**Address Range:** `$008000` - `$00FFFF`
**Summary:** The heart of the game engine. Contains the main game loop, interrupt handlers, and the primary game state machine.

#### Key Structures & Routines:
*   **`Reset:` (#_008000)**: Game entry point on boot.
*   **`MainGameLoop:` (#_008034)**: Central loop, calls `Module_MainRouting`.
*   **`Module_MainRouting:` (#_0080B5)**: Primary state machine dispatcher. Reads `MODE` (`$7E0010`) and uses `pool Module_MainRouting` to jump to the correct game module.
*   **`Interrupt_NMI:` (#_0080C9)**: Runs every frame. Handles input (`NMI_ReadJoypads`), graphics DMA (`NMI_DoUpdates`), and sprite preparation (`NMI_PrepareSprites`).

#### Search Heuristics:
*   **Game Module Logic (Overworld, Underworld, Menus):** Search `bank_00.asm` for the `pool Module_MainRouting` jump table. The labels (e.g., `Module09_Overworld`) are the entry points for each game state, determined by WRAM `$7E0010` (`MODE`).
*   **Per-Frame Logic:** Search `bank_00.asm` for `Interrupt_NMI:`. Key routines called from here are `NMI_ReadJoypads` (input) and `NMI_DoUpdates` (graphics DMA).
*   **Initialization Logic:** Start at the `Reset:` label in `bank_00.asm` and trace `JSR`/`JSL` calls to routines like `InitializeMemoryAndSRAM`.

### 8.2. Bank $01: Dungeon Engine

**File:** `ALTTP/bank_01.asm`
**Address Range:** `$018000` - `$01FFFF`
**Summary:** Responsible for loading, drawing, and managing all aspects of interior rooms (dungeons, houses, caves).

#### Key Structures & Routines:
*   **`Underworld_LoadRoom:` (#_01873A)**: Main entry point for loading a dungeon room.

## 10. Oracle of Secrets Specific Guidelines for Gemini

To ensure accurate and consistent modifications within the Oracle of Secrets project, adhere to the following guidelines regarding memory management and code placement:

- **Understand `incsrc` Order:** The order of `incsrc` directives in `Oracle_main.asm` is paramount. It dictates the final ROM layout, especially for code and data placed using `org`. Always consult `Oracle_main.asm` and `Docs/Core/MemoryMap.md` to understand the current memory allocation before introducing new `org` directives.

- **`org` for New Features:** When implementing new features that require significant code or data, use `org $XXXXXX` to place them in an appropriate free bank. Refer to the detailed memory map in `Docs/Core/MemoryMap.md` and the `Oracle_main.asm` comment for available and designated banks. If a new bank is needed, ensure it does not conflict with existing allocations or ZScream reserved space.

- **`pushpc`/`pullpc` for Patches:** For small, targeted modifications to vanilla code or data (e.g., changing a few bytes, hooking a jump), use `pushpc`/`pullpc`. These directives are ideal for non-intrusive patches that don't require a dedicated bank. Examine `Core/patches.asm` and `Util/item_cheat.asm` for examples of this usage.

- **Consult Memory Map:** Before any code modification involving `org` or `pushpc`/`pullpc`, always cross-reference with `Docs/Core/MemoryMap.md` and the `Oracle_main.asm` comment to prevent memory conflicts and ensure proper placement.

- **Prioritize Existing Conventions:** Mimic the existing style and structure of the codebase. If a new feature is similar to an existing one, follow its implementation pattern, including how it manages memory.

- **Avoid Arbitrary `org`:** Never use `org` without a clear understanding of the target address and its implications for the overall ROM layout. Unplanned `org` directives can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.
