# GEMINI.md (Compact)

Purpose: concise Gemini-specific routing for this folder.

Gemini Rules
1. Follow local `AGENTS.md` first when both exist.
2. Minimize scope and avoid unnecessary refactors.
3. Reuse existing project commands and scripts.
4. Run targeted verification before completion.
5. Be explicit when checks were skipped or unavailable.
6. Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous.

Response Contract
- What changed
- What was checked
- Known limitations or next actions

Reference Material
- Full legacy guidance: `.context/knowledge/agent-reference.md`.
- Use repository docs as source of truth for implementation details.
