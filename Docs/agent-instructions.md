# Agent Instructions

Active instruction files in this project are intentionally short for better model compliance:
- AGENTS.md
- CLAUDE.md
- GEMINI.md

Detailed guidance is stored here:
- ../.context/knowledge/agent-reference.md

Policy:
- Keep active instruction files <= 30 lines.
- Store long workflows/checklists in the agent reference file.
