# Debugging (Start Here Inside Docs/)

Primary entry point is still `RUNBOOK.md` at the repo root, but if you are browsing inside `Docs/`, this folder contains the supported debugging/testing workflows.

## Golden Path

- Quickstart: `Agent/Quickstart.md`
- Tools index: `Debugging_Tools_Index.md`
- Root-cause workflow: `Root_Cause_Debugging_Workflow.md`
- Fast travel / save-data profiles: `Fast_Travel_and_Test_Setups.md`
- Save-state library: `Testing/SaveStateLibrary.md`

## Structure

- `Agent/`: how to operate the emulator + client as a human/agent
- `Issues/`: active investigations + root-cause notes (with an `archive/` subfolder for historical writeups)
- `Guides/`: general development guidelines + troubleshooting
- `Testing/`: regression tests + state library docs + manifests
- `Training/`: older training prompts/examples (not required day-to-day)
