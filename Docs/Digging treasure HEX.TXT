Random treasure dig-up by shovel by Conn

Apply on any hacked or native ALTTP (US).



(1) nop out restriction to only collect treasures in field:
03/A3B2: ad fc 03 f0 04 -> ea ea ea ea ea (check if treasure hunt game is on)
0e/fd65: b0 28 -> ea ea (check if you are in field coordinates)

(2) disable random HC-piece dig-up:
0E/FD7A: 90 FD -> 8F FD
** you need to place this HC via HM to another location, since it isn't available anymore

(3) explanation how to alter the dig-up treasures; not part of hack...
every time you dig there is calculated a randomized Y-value which determines whether you find treasure or not.
There are 8 possibilities. 
Note: Only 4 treasures are alterable with the table, the rest is nothing

pointer table:
0E/FD72: 8A FD - get treasure
0E/FD74: 8A FD - get treasure
0E/FD76: 8A FD - get treasure
0E/FD78: 8A FD - get treasure
0E/FD7A: 8F FD - nothing - Before it was 90 FD: get Heart Piece; if 90 FD code will check if you already collected, if yes, you get nothing
0E/FD7C: 8F FD - nothing
0E/FD7E: 8F FD - nothing
0E/FD80: 8F FD - nothing

if you get pointed to a treasure (8A FD), the Y determines which one you get.

Treasure table:
0e/fd86: DB - 20 ruppees
0e/fd87: DA - 5 ruppees
0e/fd88: D9 - 1 ruppee
0e/fd89: DF - small magic

Treasure Key:
D8: heart
D9: 1 ruppee
DA: 5 ruppees
DB: 20 ruppees
DC: 1 bomb
DD: 4 bombs
DE: 8 bombs
DF: small magic
E0: large magic
E1: 5 arrows
E2: 10 arrows
E3: fairy
E4... small dungeon, key, big key, sprites, other nonsense...
