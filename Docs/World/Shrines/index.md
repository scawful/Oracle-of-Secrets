## Shrine Characteristics

Shrines differ from full dungeons in several ways:

1. **Size:** Typically 1-3 rooms
2. **Complexity:** Simpler puzzles focused on a single mechanic
3. **Rewards:** Pendants (early game) or Essences (late game)
4. **Prerequisites:** Often require specific items or story progress to access
