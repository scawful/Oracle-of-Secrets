# Secrets Mechanics Design

This document outlines the core gameplay mechanics centered around the **Book of Secrets**, the primary tool for interacting with the hidden layer of reality in *Oracle of Secrets*.

## 1. The Book of Secrets (Core Tool)

The Book of Secrets is not just a passive log; it is an active tool that allows Link to perceive and manipulate the "Source Code" of the world (the layer Ganondorf is trying to rewrite).

### A. The Reality Lens (Passive/Hold)
*   **Mechanic:** When the Book is equipped (or a specific button is held, e.g., 'L'), Link perceives the "Hidden Layer" (BG2 Toggles off/on).
*   **Visuals:** The screen flickers slightly. Fake walls disappear; hidden platforms appear as "wireframe" or ghostly images.
*   **Narrative:** Link is reading the true state of the world, bypassing the illusions created by the Eon Abyss.

### B. The Inspector (Active Use)
*   **Mechanic:** Using the Book on specific "Ancient Tablets" or "Glitch Nodes" triggers the **Inspection Interface**.
*   **Function:**
    *   **Readable Text:** Translates ancient Hylian instantly.
    *   **Encrypted Text:** Triggers the **Cipher Minigame**.

### C. The Cipher Minigame
*   **Concept:** Ganondorf has encrypted parts of reality to hide his tracks. Link must "hack" the lock.
*   **gameplay:**
    *   **Style:** A "Pipe Dream" or "Rotation" puzzle.
    *   **Goal:** Rotate concentric rings of runes to align a specific pattern (The Triforce or an Eye).
    *   **Reward:** Unlocks a door, reveals a chest, or adds a "Restored Page" to the Hall of Secrets.

### D. The Auditory Tuner
*   **Mechanic:** The Book resonates with the "Hum of the Universe."
*   **Cue:** When near a hidden secret (buried item, invisible door), the Book icon in the HUD flashes, and a low, rhythmic humming sound plays. The pitch increases as Link gets closer.

## 2. The Hall of Secrets (Hub)

Located inside the Great Maku Tree, this is the resistance's base of operations.

### A. The Archive (Collection)
*   **Function:** Stores "Restored Pages" found in dungeons or decoded from Ciphers.
*   **Gameplay:** Returning pages restores the Maku Tree's memory, unlocking hints for the next dungeon or upgrading the Book's abilities (e.g., "Range Up" for the Auditory Tuner).

### B. The Echo Chamber
*   **Concept:** A room where the Maku Tree remembers sounds.
*   **Mechanic:** Link can "record" unique sounds found in the world (e.g., a specific bird call, a machine's hum) using the Book.
*   **Usage:** In the Echo Chamber, playing these sounds unlocks "Sonic Doors" or reveals hidden items in the hub.

## 3. World Puzzles

### A. Code Breaker Doors
*   **Concept:** Sealed doors that require a 4-Rune Passcode.
*   **Clues:** The answer is always hidden in the immediate environment, but visible only via the **Reality Lens** (Book).
    *   *Example:* The door asks for "The order of the seasons." The Reality Lens reveals hidden seasonal symbols on four pillars in the room.
*   **Input:** A simple menu to cycle through 4 slots of runes.

### B. Sonic Doors
*   **Concept:** Barriers that shatter only when hit with a specific resonance.
*   **Mechanic:** Link must play a specific song on the Ocarina or use a recorded "Echo" to open them.
*   **Hint:** The door hums a specific note when struck with the sword. Link must match it.

## 4. Minigame Ideas

### A. The Memory Match (Glitch Fix)
*   **Context:** "Healing" a corrupted NPC or Chest.
*   **Gameplay:** A quick "Simon Says" sequence. The glitch flashes a pattern of colors/sounds; Link must repeat it to stabilize the object.

### B. The Rune Grid (Logic Puzzle)
*   **Context:** Unlocking high-level checks.
*   **Gameplay:** A 3x3 grid where you must toggle lights. Toggling one affects neighbors. (Classic "Lights Out" puzzle).
