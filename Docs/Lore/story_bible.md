## 1. World Overview

### Kalyxo Island

A remote island in the eastern seas, home to Farore, the Oracle of Secrets. Kalyxo exists at a unique convergence point where the boundaries between realms are thin. The island's geography mirrors its dual nature: lush forests and peaceful villages on the surface, with ancient ruins and sealed chambers beneath.

**Key Locations:**
- Wayward Village (main settlement)
- Hall of Secrets (Farore's sanctuary, the Great Maku Tree)
- Mount Snowpeak (northern highlands)
- Zora Sanctuary (eastern coast)
- Korok Cove (forested wetlands)

### The Eon Abyss

The Eon Abyss is not merely another dimension—it is Kalyxo's **shadow reflection**, a mirror-world that shows what the island becomes when hope dies. Time moves differently there; centuries in the Abyss may be moments on Kalyxo, or vice versa.

The Abyss was not always a place of darkness. In the Age of Secrets, it served as a realm of possibility—a place where the island's magic could be amplified and shaped. But when Kydrog was sealed within it, his hatred and despair corrupted the reflection. Now the Abyss bleeds through at the edges, causing the island's slow decline.

**Key Locations:**
- Temporal Pyramid (the seal's heart, where Kydrog was bound)
- Forest of Dreams (corrupted reflection of Kalyxo's woods)
- Lava Lands (the deepest layer, where Kydrog's true form waits)
- Fortress of Secrets (Kydrog's stronghold, built from stolen memories)

### The Relationship Between Worlds

The Eon Abyss reflects Kalyxo like a dark mirror. What thrives on the island withers in the Abyss; what is forgotten on Kalyxo grows monstrous below. The three Shrines serve as **anchor points** between the worlds—they were used to create the seal, and they maintain the boundary.

When the seal weakens:
- Shadows grow longer on Kalyxo
- The dead stir in forgotten places
- Portals flicker open unbidden
- Kydrog's influence seeps through

## 2. Timeline of Eras

### The Age of Secrets (Ancient Past)

The golden age of Kalyxo. The Oracle bloodline flourished, and the island's inhabitants—Zora, Gorons, and the native Kalyxians—lived in harmony. The Shrines of Wisdom, Power, and Courage were places of pilgrimage where the boundary between worlds could be safely traversed.

**The First Sealing:** Long ago, a hero from another land defeated a great evil—Ganondorf, the Gerudo King—and sealed him in the Eon Abyss rather than destroy him utterly. The three Shrines were used as anchor points for the seal, binding him to the Lava Lands at the Abyss's heart.

The Gossip Stones are **petrified witnesses** to this sealing—Kalyxians who chose to become eternal watchers, preserving the memory of what happened so it would never be forgotten.

**Note:** This is a different Ganondorf than the Pig Ganon of Ages/Seasons. The Zelda timeline has multiple incarnations of Ganon/Ganondorf across eras.

### The Age of Portals (Centuries Ago)

The Zora, studying the Shrines and the boundary between worlds, developed **crystal-mirror magic**—the ability to create smaller, controlled portals using crystals mined by the Gorons. This technology brought prosperity but also drew unwanted attention.

The Hylian Kingdom, hearing rumors of portal magic that could threaten their borders, sent forces to "secure" Kalyxo. They claimed to protect the island from external threats, but their true goal was to suppress or control the portal technology.

### The Age of Occupation (Recent Past)

Hylian restrictions caused the island's population to dwindle. The Zora withdrew to their sanctuary. The Gorons retreated to their mines. The native Kalyxians scattered or submitted. The Oracle Farore maintained the seal in secret, but with fewer believers and less magic flowing through the land, the seal began to weaken.

### The Present Day (Post-Linked Ending)

**Oracle of Secrets is Chapter 3** of the Oracle trilogy, set sometime after the events of Ages/Seasons.

What happened before:
- In Holodrum and Labrynna, Twinrova lit the Flames of Sorrow, Despair, and Destruction
- They resurrected Pig Ganon, but the ritual was incomplete
- A hero defeated the mindless Ganon

What happens now:
- Twinrova, undeterred, have found a new master: the Ganondorf sealed in the Eon Abyss
- They've been working through Kydrog to weaken the seal
- Kydrog invades Kalyxo, kidnaps Farore, and casts Link into the Abyss
- Link survives, becoming the first person in centuries to walk between worlds freely

The stakes are higher: if Ganondorf escapes, this won't be a mindless beast—it will be the calculating wizard-king at full power.

## 3. Key Characters

### Farore, Oracle of Secrets

The current Oracle of Secrets, keeper of hidden knowledge and guardian of the seal. Farore knows the true history of Kydrog—including who he once was. She maintains the seal through ritual and will, but cannot strengthen it alone.

**Role in Story:** Kidnapped in the prologue, rescued after D7. Provides exposition and guides Link to the final confrontation.

**Secret:** Farore may be the last descendant of the Oracle bloodline—the same bloodline as the guardians who created the seal. This is why Kydrog needs her specifically.

### Kydrog, The Pirate King

**True Origin:** Kydrog was once a hero—a knight sent to investigate disturbances in the Meadow of Shadows, a liminal realm where the boundary to the Eon Abyss had grown thin. He sought to stop an ancient evil stirring in the deep. He failed. He died. The Abyss claimed him.

**The Corruption:** As a newly-risen Stalfos, the fallen hero wandered the Eon Abyss in confusion and despair. Ganon, sealed in the deepest layer, sensed a hero's spirit—and began to whisper. Over centuries, Ganon nurtured the knight's bitterness: anger at his failure, resentment toward those who couldn't save him, hatred for the Oracle who held secrets that might have helped him. These feelings were real. Ganon simply... cultivated them.

**The Transformation:** The knight became Kydrog—the Stalfos King of Pirates. He built a twisted empire in the Abyss, his Dragon Ship sailing between realities, crewed by spirits of the drowned. He styles himself "King of Pirates" because he plunders not treasure, but **memories and magic**. He has his own goals, his own rage. He is not Ganon's puppet—but he is Ganon's pawn.

**His Living Name:** Lost to time. The Gossip Stones no longer speak it. (TBD - considering: Kel, Rulf, Dorn, or left unnamed as "The Fallen Knight")

**His Weapon:** The Meadow Blade—left behind when he fell. Now found in Kalyxo Castle, waiting for a new hero.

**Forms:**
- Pirate Form (D7 boss) - His preferred manifestation, humanoid Stalfos lord
- Dragon Form (Kydreeok) - His corrupted true shape, a multi-headed gleeok-like abomination
- Skeleton Stalfos (Final phase) - What remains when the dragon form is broken

**Motivation:** Kydrog believes he wants the Triforce to remake himself, to undo his death, to have the power he lacked. What he doesn't fully realize is that his actions serve Ganon's escape. Capturing Farore, gathering the essences, weakening the seals—it all feeds the prison's decay.

**Redemption Potential:** When Kydrog finally falls, there may be a moment of clarity—the hero he once was surfacing briefly. Whether he can act on it, and how, remains to be seen. (Options: empowers the Meadow Blade, reveals Ganon's weakness, simply finds peace)

### The Great Maku Tree

Ancient tree spirit who serves as Farore's sanctuary and counsel. The Maku Tree remembers the Age of Secrets and knows the locations of the Triforce Essences—fragments of sacred power scattered across Kalyxo when the seal was created.

### Impa

Zelda's attendant from Hyrule, sent to Kalyxo to assess the situation after the Oracle games' events. She helps Link escape the initial ambush and serves as his guide in the early game.

### Ganondorf, The Intuder

**The Dark Victor:** This is not a resurrection. This is an invasion.
In a timeline where the Hero of Time fell and darkness reigned supreme, Ganondorf achieved total victory. But a god-king craves new worlds to conquer. Slipping through a fracture in reality caused by the botched resurrection in *Ages/Seasons*, this "Dark Victor" entered the world of the Oracles.

**The Anomaly:** Because he does not belong to this timeline, reality rejects him. He is forced to hide in the **Eon Abyss**, the shadow of existence, to avoid being erased by the universe's natural defenses.

**His Goal:** He seeks Farore not just for her divinity, but because as the Oracle of Secrets, she holds the "source code" to this reality. If he consumes her knowledge, he can rewrite the timeline to make his existence permanent, effectively overwriting the history where Link won.

**Visuals:** He wears the tattered cloak of a king, but his form flickers like a glitch. He carries trophies from his victory—perhaps a cracked Hylian Shield or a corrupted Ocarina.

### Twinrova (The Echoes)

**Origin:** The Twinrova from this world died in the Linked Ending. These versions are **Memory Constructs**—manifestations of their intense ambition and malice, given form by the Eon Abyss.

**Nature:** They are "Echoes" of the witches, existing only where the Abyss bleeds into Kalyxo. They are desperate to merge the worlds because it is the only way they can become "real" again. They serve the Intruder Ganondorf because he promises them true resurrection in his rewritten world.

### Impa & The Maku Tree

**Impa:** No longer just a nursemaid. She recognizes the "wrongness" of this Ganondorf's magic—it feels like the ancient stories of the Great War, but twisted. She serves as Link's strategic commander, coordinating the resistance from the Hall of Secrets.

**The Maku Tree:** The Maku Tree senses the timeline rot. It is the only entity old enough to remember the "correct" history, and its roots act as a stabilizer for reality. Losing the Maku Tree would mean the instant collapse of the timeline.

The current Oracle of Secrets, keeper of hidden knowledge and guardian of the seal. Farore knows the true history of Kydrog—including who he once was. She maintains the seal through ritual and will, but cannot strengthen it alone.

**Role in Story:** Kidnapped in the prologue, rescued after D7. Provides exposition and guides Link to the final confrontation.

### Native Kalyxians

The original inhabitants of Kalyxo, now scattered and diminished. They remember the old ways and the old names. Many have become reclusive, living in hidden groves or forgotten caves. The Gossip Stones are their ancestors—those who chose to watch rather than flee.

### The Zora of Kalyxo

A distinct branch of Zora who developed crystal-mirror magic. They built the Zora Temple as both a place of worship and a research facility for portal technology. The Sea Zora and River Zora have a long-standing conflict (details TBD).

After Hylian occupation, they retreated to their sanctuary and became isolationist. Link must earn their trust to access the Zora Temple.

### The Gorons

Mountain-dwelling miners who provided the crystals for Zora portal technology. They inhabit the Goron Mines on Mount Snowpeak. Their relationship with the Zora was once symbiotic—crystals for fish, stone for water magic.

The Hylian occupation disrupted trade routes, and the Gorons now guard their mines jealously. The Rock Meat collection quest rebuilds trust.

### Hylian Occupation Forces

Not villains, but not heroes either. The Hylian soldiers at Kalyxo Castle believe they're protecting the realm from dangerous magic. They're not wrong—portal technology IS dangerous—but their heavy-handed approach has caused more harm than good.

The Castle Prison sequence shows this gray morality: Link is imprisoned not by evil guards, but by scared soldiers following orders.

## 5. Sacred Sites

### The Three Shrines

Built during the Age of Secrets as anchor points between Kalyxo and the Eon Abyss. Each shrine embodies one aspect of the Triforce and was guarded by a champion who sacrificed themselves to create the seal.

| Shrine | Aspect | Guardian's Sacrifice | Current State |
|--------|--------|---------------------|---------------|
| Shrine of Wisdom | Knowledge, Foresight | Gave up their memories | Flooded, requires Flippers |
| Shrine of Power | Strength, Endurance | Gave up their body | Volcanic, requires Power Glove |
| Shrine of Courage | Will, Hope | Gave up their future | Shadowed, requires Mirror Shield |

**The Pendants:** Completing each shrine yields a pendant—crystallized essence of the guardian's sacrifice. Together, the three pendants can forge the Master Sword, the only weapon capable of permanently banishing Kydrog.

### The Hall of Secrets

Farore's sanctuary, built around the Great Maku Tree. Contains the accumulated knowledge of the Oracle bloodline. After rescuing Farore, Link returns here to learn the truth about Kydrog and receive final guidance.

### The Temporal Pyramid

The heart of the seal, located in the deepest part of the Eon Abyss. This is where Kydrog was originally bound. The pyramid exists outside normal time—within it, Link experiences visions of past and future.

The final dungeon (Fortress of Secrets) leads here, where Kydrog waits in his true form.

---

## 6. Magic Systems

### Portal/Mirror Magic

Developed by the Zora from studying the Shrines. Uses specially cut crystals to create stable doorways between Kalyxo and the Eon Abyss (or specific locations within either realm).

**Key Items:**
- Magic Mirror: Allows travel between worlds at designated points
- Moon Pearl: Maintains Link's form in the Eon Abyss (without it, he would become a shadow)

### The Essences

Seven crystallized fragments of Triforce energy, scattered across Kalyxo when the seal was created. Each essence embodies an aspect of the island's nature:

| Essence | Dungeon | Meaning |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Whispering Vines | D1 Mushroom Grotto | Growth, secrets hidden in nature |
| Celestial Veil | D2 Tail Palace | Flight, freedom, aspiration |
| Crown of Shadows | D3 Kalyxo Castle | Authority, the burden of power |
| Luminous Mirage | D4 Zora Temple | Reflection, truth beneath surfaces |
| Ebon Ember | D5 Glacia Estate | Duality, fire within ice |
| Seismic Whisper | D6 Goron Mines | Foundation, voices of the earth |
| Demise's Thorn | D7 Dragon Ship | Endings, the price of ambition |

Collecting all seven essences allows Link to break the seal on the Fortress of Secrets.

### Masks & Transformations

Masks in Oracle of Secrets are vessels for **trapped spirits or echoes**. The Song of Healing releases a spirit's pain and crystallizes it into a wearable mask.

| Mask | Source | Transformation |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Deku Mask | Deku NPC (Song of Healing) | Minish-like form, hover, pea shooter |
| Zora Mask | Zora Temple quest | Dive underwater |
| Wolf Mask | Wolfos mini-boss (Song of Healing) | Dig ability |
| Stone Mask | Happy Mask Salesman | Invisibility |
| Bunny Hood | Happy Mask Salesman | Speed boost |

## 9. Meadow of Shadows (Prequel Context)

*Meadow of Shadows is a separate ROM hack depicting the fallen hero's final quest. This section provides context for how it connects to Oracle of Secrets.*

### Overview

The Meadow of Shadows is a liminal realm—a dreamlike space where the boundary between Kalyxo and the Eon Abyss grows thin. Time moves strangely there. Those who enter sometimes forget why they came.

### The Hero's Quest

A knight (Kydrog's living self) was sent to investigate disturbances emanating from the Meadow. Something ancient was stirring. His journey took him through:

| Location | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Forest Dungeon | Seek blessing from old spirits (Lost Woods area) |
| Eastern Sanctum | Recover an artifact or seal fragment (Palace ruins) |
| Church of Twilight | Attempt to strengthen the barrier (Central meadow) |
| Mountain Gauntlet | Reach Ganon's prison... and fail |

### The Fall

The knight reached the seal that holds Ganon—and Ganon broke him. Not through force, but through despair. The knight died in the mountain, his spirit claimed by the Abyss.

### The Meadow Blade

His sword remained behind, absorbing the realm's twilight energy. It was later recovered and brought to Kalyxo Castle, where Link finds it as the dungeon item—unknowingly taking up the fallen hero's weapon.

### Future Development

Meadow of Shadows could be expanded to:
- Show Ganon's whispers beginning
- Hint at Twinrova's involvement
- Depict the moment of death/transformation
- Connect more explicitly to Oracle of Secrets' lore

## 10. Open Questions

*Items requiring creative decisions:*

1. **Sea Zora vs River Zora conflict** - What caused it? How does Link resolve it?
2. **Ranch Girl / Twinrova connection** - Is she their daughter? A transformed victim? A spy?
3. **Kydrog's original identity** - Was he a good king corrupted, or always ambitious?
4. **The Oracle bloodline** - Are there other descendants? Did the guardians have families?
5. **Post-game state** - Does the Eon Abyss remain accessible? Does it heal?
