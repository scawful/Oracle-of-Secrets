# Distribution Policy

This project is hobby work and Nintendo-adjacent. Distribution is patch-only.

## Allowed
- Share patches (e.g., BPS) that modify a user-supplied ROM.
- Share source code and build scripts.

## Not allowed
- Do not distribute ROMs or ROM-derived binaries.
- Do not distribute asset packs extracted from ROMs.
- Do not bundle or mirror proprietary Nintendo content.

## User responsibility
- Users must provide their own legally obtained ROM.
